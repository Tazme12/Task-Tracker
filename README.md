If the user selects 1 in the main menu function then user can input their task and it will be added to the json file (file.json). 

### Update Task
If the user inputs 2 in the main menu then the user will be able to update the description of a task, also the code will add the time that the task was updated and asign it to the 'updatedat' variable.
